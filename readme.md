Simple Notes App
This repository contains a basic Vue.js-based notes application. The app is implemented using a single HTML file, and dependencies are loaded via CDNs. It allows users to create, display, and delete notes in a simple interface. The styling is handled by MDBootstrap (MDB) and custom CSS.

Delete Notes: Users can remove notes from the list.

Technologies Used
Vue.js CDN: The app is powered by Vue.js to handle reactive data and user interactions.
MDBootstrap (MDB) CDN: The MDBootstrap library is used for styling and layout.
Custom CSS: Additional custom styles are applied to enhance the look and feel.

File Structure
